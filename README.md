## Just Tarot.

Honestly, I got pretty tired of online tarot websites.

Every site seemed to be drowning in ads, packed with endless fluff text, or would randomly disappear after a few months. I just wanted somewhere clean and simple to pull cards.

So I made this. A straightforward, no-BS page where you can get your reading without all the noise.

The whole thing is in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文). I'm learning the language right now, and building this was a fun way to actually use what I've been studying.

No ads, no sign-ups, no lengthy backstories. Just Tarot.
